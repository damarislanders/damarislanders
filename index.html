<H2>PERSONAL SUMMARY</H2>
<P>
I am a master’s student, currently enrolled in the final months of MSc Wildlife and Conservation Management at the University of South Wales. I have an undergraduate background in Software Engineering. I am a very friendly and approachable person who thrives within a team. 
I am currently writing my master thesis which has required me to thoroughly research aspects of marine ecology and conservation and analyse and interpret large data sets. 
My most recent role as a student developer allowed me to exercise my ability to solve problems while programming and project planning. The position required strong attention to detail to avoid errors. 
I am passionate about the environment, animals and deepening my understanding of ecology. Therefore, I am looking for an opportunity to contribute my skill set and collaborate within a happy, environmentally focused company.
